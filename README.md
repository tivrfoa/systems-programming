"Sometimes people ask me: how do you learn systems programming.

Systems programming is not the same as kernel programming, it's not the same as application programming, it's like a mixture between the two.

It requires understanding of how an operating system works, while also understanding the needs of the application you're trying to develop, and trying to make code work efficiently within the bounds of what an operating system can do."

"The best mechanism that I've learned to learn systems programming, that I've tried to encourage some of my students to do, is to use strace to trace some common programs. You might start with something like cp or ls, strace them, then try to reproduce them by writing your own code, by looking just at the system calls that the program makes. Then looking up the documentation for each of those system calls and try to produce a copy of that program, without looking at its source code, just from the system call level.

You'll learn an awful lot!

It's a little hobby. The first time I started doing this I found a security hole in /bin/touch

You get some fascinating things when you look at programs at that level."
